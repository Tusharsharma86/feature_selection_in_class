#### 1. True-False: We use confidence intervals for for deciding whether the population supports a specific idea/model/hypothesis.

* True
* False

Sol: False
We use Hypothesis Testing for deciding whether the population supports a specific idea/model/hypothesis

#### 2. Type 1 Error : False Positives :: Type 2 Error : ?

* False Positives
* True Positives
* False Negatives
* True Negatives

sol: False Negatives

#### 3. True-False: With the Chi-squared test, we can test whether a sample mean differs from the an expected (population) mean for numeric variables.

* True
* False

Ans: False. Chi-squared test is for categorical variables

#### 4. In Wrapper Methods which of the following methods are used?

* Forward Selection
* Backward Elimination
* Recursive Feature elimination
* All of the above

Sol: All of the above

#### 5. Which are the methods used for feature selection.

* Filter Methods
* Wrapper Methods
* Embedded Methods
* All of the above

Sol: All of the above

#### 6. what are Filter Methods used in Feature Selection.

* Pearsonâ€™s Correlation 
* LDA(Linear discriminant analysis)
* ANOVA
* Chi-Square
* All of the above
* None of the above

#### 7. True-False: Feature selection is different from dimensionality reduction

* False
* True

Sol: True

Both methods seek to reduce the number of attributes in the dataset, but a dimensionality reduction method do so by creating new combinations of attributes,
where as feature selection methods include and exclude attributes present in the data without changing them.

#### 8. True-False: LASSO is one more method for feature Selection

* True
* False

Sol: True

#### 9. Why do we use feature selection?

* To enables the machine learning algorithm to train faster.
* reduces the complexity of a model and makes it easier to interpret
* improves the accuracy of a model if the right subset is chosen.
* It reduces overfitting.
* All of the above

#### 10. True-False: In Filter Methods, each feature is considered separately, thereby ignoring feature dependencies, which may lead to worse classification performance when
	compared to other types of feature selection techniques.

* True
* False 

Sol: True
